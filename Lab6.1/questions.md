### Lab 6 Questions

1. Cylindrical projections are more common in web maps because it makes finding places much easier when the map is in a grid shape. 

2. In monochromatic choropleth maps like this, audiences are likely to interpret darker colors as having "more" of something, in this case, "more age", or "older" houses. Similar to how people notice **bold text** more than normal text, darker colors bring more attention to something when placed next to lighter colors (contrast). It focuses the viewer on a specific variable or feature. If the title was "brand new Lincoln homes," I would flip this and put the focus (bolder color) on newer homes because that's what the map's focus is on.
